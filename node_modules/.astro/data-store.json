Briefly, we created a back-worn haptic device that utilizes dynamic 2D weight shifting to provide haptic feedback. Through the combination of visual feedback on wing movements and haptic feedback from weight shifting, the user experiences enhanced wing motions. Using three user studies, we proved our ideas. The final result has been published in the 2025 **ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference** and received the **Best Paper Award.** You could find it here.
